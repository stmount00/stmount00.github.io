						<h2>The Life of a Proud Cat Dad</h2>
						<p>Living alone is much less lonely when you have two rambunctious animals keeping you busy. No matter how much they might get on my nerves, I always love having them around. Sometimes cats are better company than people!</p>

						<h3>Sophie</h3>
						<p>Sophie was my first cat, a somewhat impulsive decision during the COVID-19 pandemic turned out to be a great choice, giving me a small, furry companion to kill the time while the world came to a halt. She hasn't grown much larger
						 since she was a kitten, but she has only gotten more fiesty while remaining just as lovable.</p>

								<h3>Mamba</h3>
								<p>I adopted Mamba shortly after moving from home and living alone to provide Sophie with a companion. He was frail, had terrible fur, and was terrified of anything that moved. Once he became more comfortable with another cat around
								 he quickly settled into his home, and has made leaps and bounds in his confidence with people. He appreciates having a warm home and food always available, and has become an absolute love-bug that everyone adores. I couldn't be more proud of how far he has come.</p>
