						<h2>A Glimpse Into my Professions</h2>
						<p>Though my studies confine me to a chair, my true calling is being outdoors.
						From Turfcare, to Arboring, to Ski Instructing and Coaching, being surrounded by nature is where I am the happiest.</p>

						<h3>Ski Instuctor/Coach</h3>
						<p>I first began teaching skiing at the age of 13, attaining my CSIA Level 1 instructor's license. Since then, I have obtained my Level 2 certificate during my time instructing at Winsport here in Calgary, Alberta. 
						Aside from just instructing, I have my Canada Freestyle FUNdamentalz coaching certificate which allows me to teach freestyle skiing to a weekly group. My personal preference has always been moguls, as I enjoy the technicalities
						of this terrain and find myself less oriented towards big air (and hard landings). All in all, I have 12 years of experience under my belt and hope to extend this into a winter career where I can advance my learning and work my way up the CSIA ranks!</p>

								<h3>Turfcare</h3>
								<p>These beautiful landscape photos were taken during my very early mornings performing Turfcare for The Glencoe Club Golf & Country Club, as well as The Calgary Golf and Country Club. The smell of freshly cut grass and seeing my footprints
								in the dew-covered grass still beings me joy when I think about it. Having a background in lawncare and landscaping, combined with my passion for golf made this job a no-brainer. I still miss it!</p>

								<h3>Arboring</h3>
								<p>I have been working as an arborist since 2019, working on and off until recent years where it is my full-time, labor intensive profession outside of the school semester. As an adrenaline junkie who loves being high up, this job
								has been great for always having new skills to hone and applying my skills more and more each day I work. Climbing trees is fun, but working the statiscally most dangerous trade does have its scary moments. Thankfully, I work with an amazing team
								whom I trust with my life, and even now I cannot wait to get back to climbing massive trees to prune and beautify the trees of personal residences and company properties.</p>
